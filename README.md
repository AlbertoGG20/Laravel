## In - mobiliaria

A project about a real estate agency on the island of Gran Canaria, using Laravel and Blade templates in this project. 
<br>

The project is based on creating a CRUD gwhere you can create, edit, delete, and display the different houses available in the database.


## :exclamation::exclamation: Annotation about the project :exclamation::exclamation:

On the show page, the images are always the same because I came up with the idea in the last few days before the deadline, and I didn't have time to change it to work correctly.

### Prerequisites :memo:

You need to have VSCode, MySQL, Node Js installed and Laragon

- **[VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**
- **[Mysql](https://dev.mysql.com//)**
- **[NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)**
- **[Laragon](https://laragon.org/)**

## Getting Started :tada:

To start, you need to clone the project inside the www folder of Laragon. <br>
Once there, in the Laragon terminal, enter the command composer install and npm install. <br>

Once they are completed, you need to migrate the database, for which you use the command php artisan migrate, and to start the application, the command is php artisan serve.

<br>

### All the commands :wrench:
<br>

```
git clone https://github.com/AlbertoGG20/Laravel
```

```
composer install
```

```
npm install
```

```
php artisan migrate
```
```
php artisan serve.
```
